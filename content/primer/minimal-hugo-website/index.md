# Minimal Hugo Website

Following Hugo [Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) you will get a site
with example content and theme. This site already has a post like structure.

I start from scratch here with the subset I need to get my first site generated.

I prepared a repository with two files (commonly added to a repository)

- LICENSE contains the license terms of the repository
- README.md contains the repository introducution for users

These files will not have any impact on the site generation. I'll hide these files when listing
folder contents. Just ignore their existence.[^dotgit]

[^dotgit]:
    there are some more files inside that I won't list up. These are _Git_ related or belong to the
    toolchain I use.

```text
/zero2hugo
    LICENSE      <-- MIT license file
    README.md    <-- repository started page
```

Reading [Directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) I know that
content sources have to be in `/content` folder.

So let's put some simple content file there. For example:

```markdown
# This is a simple Page

having a paragraph.

## level2 heading

and another paragraph in level 2
```

I will put a more elaborated markdown file there, that also displays the exact content of each used
source file. I put this file to `/content/index.md` - which I hope will be converted to the
generated site as `index.html`.

Now I use the [hugo command](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/) to guide me through the setup
by trying to generate the site.

> `hugo`
>
> ```text
> Total in 0 ms
> Error: Unable to locate config file or config directory. Perhaps you need to create a new site.
> Run `hugo help new` for details.
> ```

So it complains about a missing
[config file](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-file) and tells where
to get assistance.

For a bare starter an empty file is enough. Let's create `/hugo.toml` and restart

> `hugo`

Oh, just one content source but 4 pages generated. Default destination folder for a hugo generated
site is `/public`. Let's check that out.

```text
/zero2hugo/public
│   index.xml
│   sitemap.xml
│
├───categories
│       index.xml
│
└───tags
        index.xml

```

Four Xml files generated but no html file. The Xml files are
[sitemap](https://gohugo.io/templates/sitemap-template/) and
[RSS feeds](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#configuration) generated by Hugo by default. We have no
use of that for our bare site.

Additionally there are warnings of missing layouts for some _kind_ of pages.

- Warning for [Taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/) which we will not use
  for now. Hugo allows us to disable the generation of unwanted default content creation in main
  config file.

- warning for [Home](https://gohugo.io/templates/homepage/). This seems to be related to our
  homepage file. So I have to definitely take care of that.

> `/hugo.toml`
>
> ```toml
> disableKinds = ['rss', 'sitemap', 'taxonomy', 'term']
> ```

## The homepage template

Hugo uses [Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/) to define the target content for generated
pages. To be able to utilize that properly you won't come around with studying the documentation in
depth. Lot's of issues raised to the [discourse community](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) are related
to difficulties in getting that right.

I just want to get my homepage generated, so I choose the most descriptive name form [Template
lookup order - HomePage]https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/#home-page. I want to generate
HTML, so my homepage template will be `/layouts/home.html`

Next I use Hugo's [Template language](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) to tell that I
wan't to add the content of the homepage source to the target page. Line 8 adds the converted
content of the source file to the template.

Of course beyond adding the converted markdown text, templates have to create valid target type
files. In my case - generating html - I have to wrap the generated in some html tags to form a valid
HTML5 file:

> `/layouts/home.html`
>
> ```html {linenos=table,hl_lines=8}
> <!doctype html>
> <html lang="en">
>   <head>
>     <meta charset="utf-8" />
>     <title>Zero 2 Hugo</title>
>   </head>
>   <body>
>     {{ .Content }}
>   </body>
> </html>
> ```

So I now have:

```text
/zero2hugo
│   .hugo_build.lock    <-- don't touch - hugo internal
│   hugo.toml           <-- configuration
│
├───content
│       index.md        <-- homepage (this pages source)
│
└───layouts
        home.html       <-- layout template for the homepage
```

Now regenerate the site.

> `hugo`
>
> ```text
> Start building sites …
> hugo v0.124.1-db083b05f16c945fec04f745f0ca8640560cf1ec+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-03-20T11:40:10Z VendorInfo=gohugoio

>                    | EN
> -------------------+-----
>   Pages            |  1
>   Paginator pages  |  0
>   Non-page files   |  0
>   Static files     |  0
>   Processed images |  0
>   Aliases          |  0
>   Cleaned          |  0
>
> Total in 11 ms
> ```

Voila one page generated and checking out the destination folder I find:

```text
/zero2hugo/public
    index.html
```

## Time to fire up the development server

> `hugo server`

> ```text

## Ramp up

All you need to publish a one pager using Hugo is:

- config file: `/hugo.toml`

  if you don't care about warnings and additional stuff created an empty file is enough

- home page layout `/layouts/home.html`

  a simple HTML skeleton for the page layout that adds the converted Markdown using `{{ .Content }}`

- page content: `/content/index.md`

  Markdown content file for the page.

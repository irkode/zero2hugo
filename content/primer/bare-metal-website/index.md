# Create a Bare Metal Website from Markdown Source using Hugo

This is just a starter to get us running with a warm welcome to _Hugo_. We know that this is _raw_
stuff and lacks proper Hugo configuration and conventions. We will deal with that in the following
chapters.

<!--more-->

[Hugo Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) allows you to set up a site
quickly containing some sample content and a theme (if you like - if you don't it will be far from
working).

I start from scratch here with the minimal subset I need to get my first site generated.

## Create content

We need a project folder to hold our website sources and additional files. Lets create one at any
place you like and name it `bare-metal-website` . Further actions are done within this folder. If
you read a folder name like `/content` in the document, it is actually
`some-root-path/bare-metal-website/c in Markdown using elements for _headings_ and _code blocks_.

For our one pager we need a markdown file. A simple `# Hello` would do.Here's a little more to show
the required files.

{{< showFile "/examples/bare-metal-website/content/index.md" "markdown" >}}

Now I use the [hugo command](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/) to guide me through the setup
by trying to generate the site.

> `hugo`
>
> ```text
> Total in 0 ms
> Error: Unable to locate config file or config directory. Perhaps you need to create a new site.
> Run `hugo help new` for details.
> ```

It complains about missing a
[config file](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#configuration-file). I'll create an
empty one using `touch hugo.toml` to please Hugo.

> `hugo`
>
> ```text
> Start building sites …
> hugo v0.125.4-cc3574ef4f41fccbe88d9443ed066eb10867ada2+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-04-25T13:27:26Z VendorInfo=gohugoio

One content source file but 4 pages generated. The default destination folder for a hugo generated
site is `/public`. Let's check that out.

```text
/bare-metal-website/public
│   index.xml
│   sitemap.xml
│
├───categories
│       index.xml
│
└───tags
        index.xml

```

Four XML files but no HTML file. The Xml files are
[sitemap](https://gohugo.io/templates/sitemap-template/) and
[RSS feeds](https://gohugo.io/templates/rss/#configuration) generated by Hugo by default. We have no
use of that for our bare site.

Additionally there are warnings of missing layouts for some _kind_ of pages.

-  Warning for [Taxonomies](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies/) which we will not use
   for now.

-  warning for [Home](https://gohugo.io/templates/homepage/). This seems to be related to our
   homepage file. So We have to definitely take care of that.

Hugo allows us to disable the generation of unwanted default content in the main config file.

> `/hugo.toml`
>
> ```toml
> disableKinds = ['rss', 'sitemap', 'taxonomy', 'term']
> ```

If you do not care about these additional files created and the warnings, just leave `hugo.toml`
empty. The final one pager will display find in a browser.

## The homepage template

Hugo uses [Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/) to define the target layout for generated pages.
To be able to utilize that properly you won't come around with studying the documentation in depth.
Lot's of issues raised to the [discourse community](https://discourse.gohugo.io/) are related to
difficulties in getting that up.

We just want one homepage generated, so selected the most descriptive name from
[Template lookup order - HomePage](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/#home-page). Target
language is HTML, so my homepage template will be `/layouts/home.html`

Next we use Hugo's [Template language](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/) to tell that we
wan't to add the content of the homepage source to the target page. Line 8 adds the converted
content of the source file to the template.

Of course beyond adding the converted markdown text, templates have to create valid target files. In
our case - generating html - we wrap the content in some html tags to form a valid HTML5 file:

> `/layouts/home.html`
>
> ```html {linenos=table,hl_lines=8}
> <!doctype html>
> <html lang="en">
>    <head>
>       <meta charset="utf-8" />
>       <title>Zero 2 Hugo</title>
>    </head>
>    <body>
>       {{ .Content }}
>    </body>
> </html>
> ```

So now we have:

```text
/bare-metal-website
│   .hugo_build.lock        -- don't touch - hugo internal
│   hugo.toml           <-- configuration
│
├───content
│       index.md        <-- homepage (this pages source)
│
├───layouts
│        home.html      <-- layout template for the homepage
│
└───public              <-- the output folder
└───resources               -- don't touch - hugo internal
```

## Regenerating the site

> `hugo`
>
> ```text
> Start building sites …
> hugo v0.125.4-cc3574ef4f41fccbe88d9443ed066eb10867ada2+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-04-25T13:27:26Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
>
>                    | EN
> -------------------+-----
>   Pages            |  1
>   Paginator pages  |  0
>   Non-page files   |  0
>   Static files     |  0
>   Processed images |  0
>   Aliases          |  0
>   Cleaned          |  0
>
> Total in 11 ms
> ```

Voila one page generated and put in available in `/public` folder:

```text
/bare-metal-website/public
    index.html
```

-  Time to fire up the development server

   > `hugo server`
   >
   > ```text
   > Watching for changes in ...\bare-metal-website\{content,layouts}
   > Watching for config changes in ...\bare-metal-website\hugo.toml
   > Start building sites …
   > hugo v0.125.4-cc3574ef4f41fccbe88d9443ed066eb10867ada2+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2024-04-25T13:27:26Z VendorInfo=gohugoio

-  preview the site by browsing _[http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)_

{{< figure src="images/bare-metal-website.png" width="25%">}}

Although the page itself does not include styles (no CSS) you will see some formatting done. All
major browsers add their default styles to at least get some basic formatting for headlines,
paragraphs, ...

## Ramp up

All you need to publish a one pager using Hugo is:

-  config file: `/hugo.toml`

   if you don't care about warnings and additional stuff created, an empty file is enough.

-  home page layout `/layouts/home.html`

   a simple HTML skeleton for the page layout that adds the converted Markdown using
   `{{ .Content }}`

-  page content: `/content/index.md`

   Markdown content file for the page.

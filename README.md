An evolving Tutorial how to setup a static website from scratch

-  generated by
   [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io/ "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites")
-  styled with
   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/ "The modern CSS framework that just works")

## Introduction

If you came here to find a quick guide to set up a static website with a nice
theme and simple setup - this is not where you are. Better start with one of the
_Hugo_ setup guides around. An easy go would be
[Hugo - Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

Zero2Hugo is **not** an introduction to Hugo, SSG, Web technologies (Html, css,
scss...), front matter, Markdown, template systems, Git, GitHub, GitHubPages,
... (yeah, buzzword bingo).

We use that all while evolving the site. We will try to describe the topics we
use up to a level of basic understanding. We will also to link to chapters in
the official [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) where
appropriate.

## Examples

While evolving the site we will push sources for the site to our code
repository. So you may have a look at each step and see all the sources at that
stage. Due to the evolving layout you can easily compare different versions of
the site.

We will link to the repository for every topic we handle. Or just jump to the
[code repository](https://github.com/irkode/zero2hugo-code).

## Let's start from Zero

**Zero** here really means from scratch. We will start with an empty local
folder and a fresh git repository. Step by step we evolve to a static website
written in Markdown, generated using Hugo and styled with Bulma.

The site finally should evolve to be fancy

-  themed
-  responsive
-  multilingual
-  versioned
-  maybe more...

## Audience

We expect you to be familiar with

-  your operating systems command line interface
-  Git
-  Markdown -- especially

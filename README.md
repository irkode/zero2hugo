An evolving primer how to setup a static website using _Hugo_ from scratch.

   [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Wikipedia Article on Markdown")
-  generated by
   [Hugo](https://www.gohugo.io/ "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites")
-  styled with
   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/ "The modern CSS framework that just works")

## Introduction

If you came here to find a quick guide to set up a static website with a nice
theme and simple setup - this is not where you are. Better start with one of the
_Hugo_ setup guides around. An easy go would be
[Hugo - Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

Zero2Hugo is **not** an introduction to Hugo, SSG, Web technologies (Html, css,
scss...), front matter, Markdown, template systems, Git, GitHub, GitHubPages,
... (yeah, buzzword bingo).

We use that all while evolving the site. We will try to describe the topics we
use up to a level of basic understanding. We will also to link to chapters in
the official [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) where
appropriate.

## Examples

While evolving we will push example sources for each site to our code
repository. Each example is a small website on it's own and runnable OOTB. Just
check out the example section or browse the repo.

## Let's start from Zero

**Zero** here really means from scratch. We will start with an empty local
folder and a fresh git repository. Step by step we evolve to a static website
written in Markdown, generated using Hugo and styled with Bulma.

The site finally should evolve to be fancy

-  themed
-  responsive
-  multilingual
-  versioned
-  maybe more...

## Audience

We expect you to be familiar with

-  your operating systems command line interface
-  Git
-  Markdown -- especially

-  HTML, CSS, SCSS, ...

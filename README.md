# Zero 2 Hugo - A Website Primer

_Zero 2 Hugo_ is an evolving Primer for creating a website from scratch using Hugo.

We develop a website starting with a bare metal one and finally reach a featured website with a nice
look and feel.

## It's not a QuickStart

If you came here to find a quick guide to set up a static website with a nice theme and simple
setup - this is not where you are. We recommend one of the tutorials around maybe one already
utilizing a Theme for layout and styling. An fast and easy go would be
[Hugo - Getting Started](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/).

## It's not an easy Hugo guide

Zero2Hugo is **not** an introduction SSG, Web technologies (Html, css, scss...), front matter,
Markdown, template systems, Git, GitHub, GitHubPages, ... (yeah, buzzword bingo).

We use all that while evolving the site but we won't get in details.

For _Hugo_ we provide a little more background information. Where appropriate we link to link to the
official [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). Be prepared to read a lot of these
pages for deeper understanding.

We expect you to be familiar with

-  Your operating systems command line interface
-  Git
-  Markdown
-  HTML, CSS, SCSS, ...
<!---->
-  basic programming skills will help

## Examples

While evolving we will push example sources for each site to our code repository. Each example is a
small website on it's own and runnable. Just check out the example section or browse the repo.

## Let's start from Zero

**Zero** here really means from scratch. We will start with an empty local folder and a fresh git
repository. Step by step we evolve to a static website written in Markdown, generated using Hugo and
styled with Bulma.

The site finally should evolve to be fancy

-  themed
-  responsive
-  multilingual
-  versioned
-  maybe more...
